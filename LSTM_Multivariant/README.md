# EconoCast v2: Multivariate LSTM for Time Series Forecasting

EconoCast v2 is a deep learning model built using Keras that predicts future stock prices (e.g., Tesla - TSLA) using historical multivariate time series data. This project demonstrates advanced time series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, incorporating multiple financial indicators to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Project Highlights

- **Multivariate LSTM Model**: Uses historical prices and technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, etc.
- **Low Forecasting Error**: Achieves strong accuracy with low MAE and RMSE.
- **Built with Deep Learning**: Trained using Keras + TensorFlow backend.
- **Real-world Dataset**: Yahoo Finance stock data (TSLA) with full preprocessing pipeline.
- **Visualized Performance**: Includes training/validation loss curves and predicted vs actual stock price charts.
